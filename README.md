# Solo-Game-Project---Part-II-Bitsy-Game-2.0

This is the new game based on the feedback from the first Bitsy project assignment. Unfortunaly, my first game was lost to the abyss from some sort of glitch on my end from either my computer or my bitsy account. This sparked a new idea for a different game for me to make. I used the feedback  from my last game to make a better game overall. I hope you enjoy!
